# commerceBackEnd

## Description

This application was built to tie together a database with the front end, via routes to the API that was built specifically for this application. It uses sequelize, sql, and express to build a local server, and connect the sql database so that the user can search for items in the database via speicific search parameters.

## Usage

To use this application, please follow the link to the GitHub repo posted below. After that, clone the repository into a folder on your local system and run an npm install to install all of the required packages that enable you to run the application. The server is connected to Port 3001 so you can visit http://localhost:3001/categories to get to the categories section of the application to see all categories, for example. Routes for search parameters can be found in the 'routes' directory.
